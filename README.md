FuzzyContacts
=============
Data extraction from fuzzy contact databases

##Motivation
Databases of contact information are hardly ever pristine, especially when the entries are unsanitized and multiple people are responsible for data entry. I wrote this script to wade through years and years of accumulated muck. 

##Installation
````bash
git clone https://github.com/huangy6/FuzzyContacts.git
mkvirtualenv fuzzyContacts
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

##Usage
````bash
cd /path/to/fuzzyContacts
workon fuzzyContacts
````
